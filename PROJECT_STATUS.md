## 🔄 Current App Flow

1. **Entry Points:**
   - `/` - Public homepage with hero, stats, features
   - `/login` - Demo auth (use `demo@vexl.it`)
   - `/dashboard` - User dashboard (requires auth)
   - `/admin/dashboard` - Admin control panel

2. **Core Features:**
   - `/workshop` - Interactive presentation viewer
   - `/admin/builder` - Visual presentation creator
   - `/presentation/[id]` - View specific presentations

3. **Authentication:**
   - Demo login bypasses Strapi
   - Token stored in localStorage
   - Protected routes redirect to login

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Strapi Integration:**
   - Currently NOT actively using Strapi for content
   - All content is hardcoded or stored in localStorage
   - Strapi backend exists but connection issues persist

2. **Missing Features:**
   - Screenshot upload doesn't persist (no backend storage)
   - Analytics tab is placeholder
   - Community/Games/Resources pages are minimal
   - No real user accounts (only demo auth)

3. **Build Warnings:**
   - Metadata warnings about themeColor/colorScheme (non-critical)
   - These don't affect functionality

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors:
- **Primary Yellow:** `#FCEE0A`
- **Black:** `#000000`
- **White:** `#FFFFFF`
- **Grays:** Scale from `#0A0A0A` to `#FAFAFA`
- **Semantic:** Success (green), Error (red), Info (blue), Warning (orange)

### Typography:
- **Primary Font:** Inter
- **Mono Font:** Space Mono
- **Heading Font:** Space Grotesk

### Key Components:
- Full-screen adaptive sections (not slides)
- Inline editable text fields
- Interactive phone mockups
- Network visualizations
- Achievement badges

## 📝 Next Steps for Polish

### High Priority:
1. **Backend Integration:**
   - Fix Strapi connection for data persistence
   - Implement proper user authentication
   - Add API endpoints for presentations

2. **Content Management:**
   - Save presentations to database
   - Add presentation sharing/export
   - Implement version history

3. **Interactive Components:**
   - Add more section templates to builder
   - Create quiz/game components
   - Build club showcase component

### Medium Priority:
1. **UI Polish:**
   - Fix text overflow in some sections
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add loading states for all async operations

2. **Features:**

   - Build out community features
   - Add resource library

3. **PWA Enhancements:**

   - Add push notifications
   - Implement background sync

### Low Priority:
1. **Documentation:**
   - User guide for ambassadors
   - API documentation
   - Component library docs

2. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests for components
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - Performance optimization

## 🚢 Deployment Information

- **Platform:** Vercel

vercel --prod
```

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

1. **Moved from slides to sections:** Full-screen adaptive content instead of constrained slides
2. **Demo auth bypass:** Allows testing without Strapi
3. **localStorage for persistence:** Temporary solution until backend is fixed
4. **Visual builder approach:** Click-to-edit instead of forms
5. **PWA-first:** Offline capability and installable app

## 📊 Current Stats

- **Total Components:** 15+ custom components
- **Interactive Elements:** Phone mockup, network viz, editable text
- **Pages:** 16 routes
- **Build Size:** ~150KB First Load JS
- **Lighthouse Score:** PWA-ready, 90+ performance

## 🎯 Project Goals Alignment

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Demo Login:** Always use `demo@vexl.it` for testing
2. **Brand Colors:** Stick to `#FCEE0A` for yellow
3. **Content:** Everything is currently client-side
4. **Deployment:** Auto-deploys from GitHub main branch

## 🤝 Handoff Notes

To continue development:
1. Fix Strapi connection for data persistence
2. Focus on polishing existing features before adding new ones
3. Test on actual devices for PWA functionality
4. Keep consistent with Vexl brand manual
5. Maintain full-screen section approach (not slides)
